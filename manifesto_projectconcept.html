    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>The Grown Folks Table explores ancestry and intergenerational storytelling through cyanotypes, documents, and intimate objects. By engaging both family elders and seniors in Brooklyn, the project preserves stories, wisdom, and daily experiences, reflecting on resilience, legacy, and the connections that shape family and community life.</p>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>Tracing my own ancestry, I found myself thinking of the life my ancestors may have lived. With only having a name, stories passed down through the memory of family members, pictures, and some personal items, I began to reimagine who they were.</p>

    <p><em>The Grown Folks Table</em> is a familial place to convene, a throne reserved only for adults. The table holds the weight of deep laughter, shared meals, and conversations both light and heavy. What was said there stayed there or traveled only among those present, absent, and always on their own accord. Children were demanded to sit at the kids’ table, to stay in a child’s place, shielded from real life happenings deemed too heavy, too complicated, or simply not theirs to know.</p>

    <p>Yet, as the journey toward the grown folks table unfolds, those stories begin to find their way to you. Sometimes whole, sometimes fractured, often blurred by half truths. At last, sitting among the elders, a new relationship begins. They get to talking. Advice is told to you, never requested yet always expected to be taken, spilling into stories that trace their lives.</p>

    <p>Arriving here is an initiation into the complexity of life.</p>

    <p>Their stories bounce through phases and eras—touching addiction, wrestling ego, navigating choices, finding joy in community, creating and sustaining life the best they could. What they’ve built rests on the table, offered only to those close enough to sit with them. While they’re still with us, we experience them in the present, but questions remain: Who are they to themselves? What have they gained in this life? What do they regret, and what do they cherish most?</p>

    <p><em>The Grown Folks Table</em> takes form through cyanotypes, archival documents, and intimate objects—hymn books, hats, sermons, stamps, and letters. These works function as living archives, preserving the conversations, memories, and artifacts of our elders. Like the table itself, they hold the laughter, lessons, contradictions, and silences that shape communal life.</p>

    <p>By teaching and becoming a resource at senior centers in Brooklyn, I connect directly with elder members both within my own family and those I meet through everyday encounters, creating spaces where their stories, wisdom, and daily experiences inform and enrich the work. Through these interactions, the project becomes a reciprocal exchange: I document, preserve, and reimagine their lives while learning from their insights, gaining deeper understanding of resilience, joy, and survival across generations.</p>

    <p>This work is both an act of remembrance and a gesture of care—a way of keeping elders close as their voices grow softer, their memories slip in and out of reach, and their earthly presence becomes more fragile. It is a reclamation of stories left unsaid and a meditation on what is passed down beyond blood: resilience, tenderness, wit, survival, and the quiet rituals that make a life. Sitting at the grown folks table is not just about inheriting their stories or their seat, but about holding space for their humanity in its entirety.</p>

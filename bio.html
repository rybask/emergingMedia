<h1> Bio</h1>
<p>Ryin Baskin is a multidisciplinary artist based in New York City whose practice examines the layered ecologies of Black existence, memory, and community across social and physical landscapes. Working across experimental photography, fiber, sound, oral histories, and video, she builds sensorial environments that stretch the boundaries between archive and imagination. 
Her work engages the everyday as a ground of both struggle and possibility, foregrounding the unseen labors that sustain communities and the narratives that resist erasure. Through immersive storytelling and material experimentation, she reclaims the overlooked histories and reimagine the conditions under which Black life continues to unfold.
She holds an MA in Digital Media from St. Francis College and an MA in Media and Mass Communications from Pace University. Her work has been featured at Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning, Long Island City Open Arts, and Flushing Town Hall. <p></p>

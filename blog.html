<p> This is my third time reading Hito Steyerl’s In Defense of the Poor Image, and each time it brings me back to the bootleg DVDs that were randomly around the house when I was growing up. They seemed to appear out of nowhere. Sometimes in a random plastic bag or sometimes laying on the dining room table. The dvd’s were always a gamble. Some copies were either the movie shown on the cover, an entirely different movie, a terrible copy, or a clear copy. 
Many family members contributed to the distribution of good copies by swapping them with each other. It wasn’t just about having movies at home. I was essentially an underground economy of everyday people creating access where it otherwise didn’t exist.
Reading Steyerl now, I realize those dvd’s were part of what is considered poor images. poor images are defined as all low resolution and copied media that hold value in their circulation rather than their clarity.
“The poor image is a copy in motion. Its quality is bad, its resolution substandard… It is a ghost of an image, a preview, a thumbnail, an errant idea, an itinerant image…” 
Even in their bootlegged form, the movies mattered. They weren’t just entertainment; they were cheap, shareable, and communal.

 <p> Reading Walter Benjamin’s The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction made me think about how much of what we experience now is a copy of a copy. His idea of the “aura”, that sense of originality and presence an artwork has feels almost impossible today when everything is instantly reproduced, reposted, or streamed. I thought about old family photos that used to live in heavy albums, in drawers or boxes. There was something sacred about flipping through those pages and feeling the gloss of the paper. Now, those same moments exist as endless duplicates on phones, drives, and clouds. His point about reproduction shifting art away from ritual toward mass consumption feels real. The ritual now is in the scroll, the repost, the share. But there’s also something inclusive about it. Everyone gets to participate, create, and circulate meaning. Maybe the aura isn’t gone, just different. It's less about the object itself and more about the collective experience surrounding it.

 <p>Reading Vannevar Bush’s As We May Think made me think about how much of what he predicted actually exists now. He talked about this idea of a “memex" which is described as a machine that could store and organize all of human knowledge, which basically sounds like the internet. It’s interesting to see how something imagined in 1945 became our everyday reality. We have access to almost everything, but it doesn’t always make us smarter, but now with more content available to us, we're just more distracted. I thought about how many notes, photos, and links I save but never actually go back to. Bush saw this technology as a way to help people think better and make new connections, but it feels like we’ve gone in the opposite direction sometimes. Instead of organizing knowledge, we just collect it endlessly and oftentimes forget about what we collect.</p>

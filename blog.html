  <h1>Emerging Media Blog Entries — Fall 2025</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <div class="date">September 13, 2025</div>
    <p>This is my third time reading Hito Steyerl’s <em>In Defense of the Poor Image</em>, and each time it brings me back to the bootleg DVDs that were randomly around the house when I was growing up. They seemed to appear out of nowhere—sometimes in a random plastic bag, sometimes on the dining room table. The DVDs were always a gamble: some were perfect copies, others were entirely different movies.
    Many family members contributed to the distribution of good copies by swapping them with each other. It wasn’t just about having movies at home; it was an underground economy of everyday people creating access where it otherwise didn’t exist. Even in their bootlegged form, the movies mattered—they were cheap, shareable, and communal.</p>

    <p>Reading Walter Benjamin’s <em>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</em> made me think about how much of what we experience now is a copy of a copy. His idea of the “aura,” that sense of originality and presence an artwork has, feels almost impossible today when everything is instantly reproduced, reposted, or streamed.
    His point about reproduction shifting art away from ritual toward mass consumption feels real. The ritual now is in the scroll, the repost, the share. Maybe the aura isn’t gone—just different. It's less about the object itself and more about the collective experience surrounding it.</p>

  <div class="entry">
    <div class="date">October 6, 2025</div>
    <p>Reading Vannevar Bush’s <em>As We May Think</em> made me think about how much of what he predicted actually exists now. He described a “memex”—a machine that could store and organize all human knowledge—which basically sounds like the internet. It’s fascinating to see how something imagined in 1945 became our everyday reality.
    We have access to almost everything, but it doesn’t always make us smarter. Bush saw this technology as a way to help people think better and make new connections, but it feels like we’ve gone in the opposite direction—endlessly collecting and rarely reflecting.</p>

  <div class="entry">
    <div class="date">October 14, 2025</div>
    <p>Reading Guy Debord’s <em>The Society of the Spectacle</em> felt like reading a breakdown of our current world. Debord says everything that was once lived directly has turned into representation; life turned into an image. He calls this “the spectacle,” where real connections are replaced by images, and commodities define value.
    It perfectly describes social media culture today. For me, the takeaway is to keep making art that cuts through performance—to show something honest instead of just another spectacle.</p>

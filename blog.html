<p> This is my third time reading Hito Steyerl’s In Defense of the Poor Image, and each time it brings me back to the bootleg DVDs that were randomly around the house when I was growing up. They seemed to appear out of nowhere. Sometimes in a random plastic bag or sometimes laying on the dining room table. The dvd’s were always a gamble. Some copies were either the movie shown on the cover, an entirely different movie, a terrible copy, or a clear copy. 
Many family members contributed to the distribution of good copies by swapping them with each other. It wasn’t just about having movies at home. I was essentially an underground economy of everyday people creating access where it otherwise didn’t exist.
Reading Steyerl now, I realize those dvd’s were part of what is considered poor images. poor images are defined as all low resolution and copied media that hold value in their circulation rather than their clarity.
“The poor image is a copy in motion. Its quality is bad, its resolution substandard… It is a ghost of an image, a preview, a thumbnail, an errant idea, an itinerant image…” 
Even in their bootlegged form, the movies mattered. They weren’t just entertainment; they were cheap, shareable, and communal.
